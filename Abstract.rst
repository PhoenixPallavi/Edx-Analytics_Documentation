IIT Bombay now has its contributions(in the form of two courses) to the prestigious edX platform. EdX is a massive open online course (MOOC) destination site and online learning platform that is open sourced, founded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. Though it is an ITS(Intelligent Tutoring System), students find out some or the other way to play around with the features of the system through which they reach the final(correct) answer without even thinking deeply about the question asked. So to avoid such instances, we need to determine those students who are gaming the system(behavior aimed at obtaining correct answers and advancing within the tutoring curriculum by systematically taking advantage of regularities in the softwareâ€™s feedback and help). For this, we analyzed the log files generated by the student activities in the ITS (Intelligent tutoring system) i.e, the edX course site and extracted some features relevant to finding out the students who are gaming the system. Determination of such students will help us in the future to intervene the learning process, so as to prevent such students from  gaming and help them in learning the course.

We have also written queries to extract information which will be useful for data analytics. Using this data, the ITS designer and the course instructors can get useful information as to how well the students are giving positive response to the system and how popular and effecive their courses are. To aid them, a visualized interface has been designed so that it becomes easier and graphically legible to infer such aspects of a student's interest.
